# duck

this can probably be considered a virus.  be careful with it; it is terrifying.

Also i stole the duck sound from youtube. It is 100% copyrighted, all credit goes to the duck.

INSTALLATION:
download the .rar file and extract, make sure the exe and the mp3 file are in the same folder.
Nothing should pop up when you run the exe, but every time you press the d key a duck will quack.
you have to go to task manager to end the process, or restart your computer.
